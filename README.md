# UQCSbot

UQCSbot is our friendly chat bot used on the [UQCS Discord Server](https://discord.uqcs.org). For the UQCSbot used in our Slack team, see [UQCSbot-Slack](https://github.com/uqcomputing/uqcsbot).

## Setup

UQCSbot uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Once you have Poetry setup on your machine, you can setup and install dependencies by running:

```bash
poetry install
```

Access to the UQCSbot testing tokens and server is provided through the #bot-testing channel on our Discord.
