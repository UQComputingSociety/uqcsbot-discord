# UQCSbot

UQCSbot is our friendly chat bot used on the [UQCS Discord Server](https://discord.uqcs.org). For the UQCSbot used in our Slack team, see [UQCSbot-Slack](https://github.com/uqcomputing/uqcsbot-slack).

## Setup & Running Locally

UQCSbot uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Once you have Poetry setup on your machine, you can setup and install dependencies by running:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Environment Variables

You'll need to define environment variables to be able to start the bot. The `.env.example` file contains a basis for what you can use as a `.env` file. You'll need to create an `.env` file with the required environment variables populated:

* `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` for the Discord provided bot token.
* `POSTGRES_URI_BOT` for the PostgreSQL connection string.

It is recommended that you acquire your own Discord bot token for testing, details can be found in the [Discord Developer Docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#creating-an-app). Make sure you also enable the Server Members Intent and Message Content Intent in your bot settings. Requests can be made to committee for bot testing tokens, but will only be approved on a case by case basis. 

More information for currently implemented environment variables can be found on [this wiki page](https://github.com/UQComputingSociety/uqcsbot-discord/wiki/Tokens-and-Environment-Variables).

### Running the Bot

Once you have a .env file, you can run the following command to start the bot:

```sh
poetry run botdev
```

To shutdown the bot, hit Ctrl+C

<summary><b>Alternative Instructions for Docker</b></summary>

UQCSbot is deployed using [Docker](https://docker.com). If you're familiar with it or want to fully simulate the production environment, you can follow these instructions instead.

If you're going to use Docker as your dev environment, make sure you have:
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

To build and start Docker, you can run: (Note that depending on how Docker is configured, you may need to prepend `sudo`)
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

To shut down the Docker environment, run:
```
docker-compose down
```

## Testing

Tests are stored in the `tests` folder and the tests for each file are prefixed with `test_`. Each test should `import pytest` and import the relevant functions from the given part of `uqcsbot`. Tests should mainly focus on cog-specific behaviours and should avoid interacting with discord (say, to detect if a message was sent; see issue [#2](https://github.com/UQComputingSociety/uqcsbot-discord/issues/2#issuecomment-1498967689)).

To run all tests:
```
poetry run pytest
```
To run a particular test, say `test_whatweekisit.py`, run:
```
poetry run pytest tests\test_whatweekisit.py
```

## Code Styling

We use an automated code formatter called [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/), currently this needs to be run manually to pass the format CI check. To run Black, run from the root of the repo:

```bash
poetry run black uqcsbot
```
