`/advent add-winner` is an admin-only command that allows you to either manually or randomly select winners. Participants will only be eligible to win if they have completed at least one star within the given times. For manual selection, provide an Advent of Code user ID (note that this is not the same as their Advent of Code name), otherwise a random winner will be drawn.
                    
The arguments for the command have a bit of nuance. They are as follow:
 `prize                   ` - A description of the prize to be given. This will be displayed when the winner is selected and if `/advent previous-winners` is used.
 `start` & `end           ` - The initial and final dates (inclusive) of the time range of the prize. To be eligible to win, participants need to get a star from ode of these days. The weights of the selected winner are determined from this range as well.
 `weights                 ` - How the winners are selected. For "Equal", each eligible participant has an equal probability of winning. For "Stars", it is as if each user gets a "raffle ticket" for each star they completed within the timeframe, meaning more stars provides a greater chance of winning.
 `number_of_winners       ` - The number of winners to randomly select.
 `allow_repeat_winners    ` -  This allows participants to win multiple times from the same selection if `number_of_winners` is greater than 1. Note that regardless of this option, someone can win multiple times in a year, just not in a single selection.
 `allow_unregistered_users` - This allows Advent of Code accounts that do not have a linked discord account to win. Note that it can be difficult to give out prizes to users that do not have a linked discord.
 `year                    ` - The year the prize is for.
